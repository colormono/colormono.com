Pen plotter drawing on paper  
210 x 297 x 1 cm

Manner Of E. Zajec, Il Cubo, 1971 is a pen plotter drawing that pays homage to the renowned artist E. Zajec's iconic work, Il Cubo, originally created in 1964. This artwork captures the essence of Zajec's avant-garde style and geometric abstraction.

The pen plotter technique used in this piece recreates the geometric intricacies, sharp lines, and mathematical precision that are characteristic of Zajec's work, while the pen plotter's setup adds a distinct layer of imprecision and mechanical failure to Zajec's vision.

The artwork serves as a bridge between the analog and digital art worlds, showcasing how technology can reinterpret and celebrate the timeless beauty of traditional art. Manner Of E. Zajec, Il Cubo, 1971 invites viewers to contemplate the interplay between art and technology while paying homage to a pioneering artist whose work continues to inspire generations.

In TVC, the main subject of invention is no longer the design of visual modules, but of procedural ones.
The focus is no longer on the geometry of projection, but on the grammatical rules that delimit the possible combinations of the constituent elements.
