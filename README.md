My portfolio has transformed over the years - from a static HTML site, to WordPress, to Jekyll, and finally to Next.js/React/MDX. My personal slice of the internet provides a platform for my note and to showcase my work.

This is a [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) project with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org) App Directory
- Radix UI Primitives
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.org)
- Icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev)
- Dark mode with [`next-themes`](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)
- Tailwind CSS class sorting, merging and linting.
- [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) and [ContentLayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Create a `.env.local` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/colormono/colormono.com/blob/master/.env.example).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
