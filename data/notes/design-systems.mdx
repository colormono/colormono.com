# Design System Notes

“WITHOUT A UNIFIED LANGUAGE, all products drift toward inconsistency.”

“A design system is the broadest of these tools, and explains how a team should create products. It encompasses the pattern library and style guide, but also includes underlying design principles, rules, and guidelines to help teams create cohesive experiences.”

Excerpts From: Yesenia Perez-Cruz. “Expressive Design Systems.” Apple Books.

## Modular building

### A pattern Library (Tooling)

Reusable UI building blocks that are shared across teams and assembled to build products.

## Principles

- Deliverate about how we approach creating, building, and maintaining the UX of our products.
- Collaborative documenting, how our team build products together.
- Spend more time on creating a shared language and less time on tools.

Design Principles are a tool for creating a better, more consistent experience for your users. They are high level principles that guide the detailed design decisions you make as you're working on a project.

There are essentially two kinds of them. **Universal** and **Specific**.

### Universal Design Principles

The universal kind, also called [Heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) applies to basic human behaviors and can be used for all kinds of designs. Examples of Universal Principles are: Jakob Nielsens famous [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/10-usability-heuristics-for-user-interface-design) and Whitney Hess's [20 Guiding Principles for Experience Design](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/20-guiding-principles-for-experience-design).

### Specific Design Principles

The other kind of Design Principles are the Specific ones You create these for a specific project to ensure a consistent design. Examples of Specific Design Principles are [Tivo's Design Principles](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/tivos-revised-design-principles) and the [Android Design Principles](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/android-design-principles). The Specific Design Principles are especially great when you're working on a big project with a lot of people involved. By establishing a set of Design Principles it's easier to keep the product aligned with the UX Vision.

### What Should I do With Them?

If you're not doing it already, you should start using Design Principles to improve the User Experience in your own projects. To get started check out [the Design Principles of others](https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/) to get inspiration for your own.

## Purpose

Your find your purpose statement describes what your team is trying to achieve with the design system. It answers **four questions**:

- _What_ is the goal for our design system?
- _Why_ is that goal important?
- _How_ will the design system help us?
- _Who_ is the design system for?

### _What_ is the goal for our design system?

Example resp: Our design system will make the quality of our products better for our audiences.

Faster to market

### _Why_ is that goal important?

Example resp:

### _How_ will the design system help us?
