## Setup Micro Front-End Monorepo with Next.js

As applications scale, you’ll inevitably reach a point where you want to write [shared reusable components](/blog/ui-component-library-with-styled-components) which can be used everywhere. Historically, we’ve had separate repositories for each package. However, this becomes a problem for a few reasons:

- It does not scale well. Before you know it, you have dozens of different package repositories repeating the same build, test, and release process.
- It promotes bundling unnecessary components. Do we need to create a new repo for this button? Let’s put it together with this other package. Now we’ve increased the bundle size for something 95% of consumers won’t use.
- It makes upgrading difficult. If you update a base component, you now have to update its consumers, its consumer’s consumers, etc. This problem gets worse as you scale.

To make our applications as performant as possible, we need to have small bundle sizes. This means we should only include the code we’re using in our bundle.

Along with this, when developing shared component libraries, we want to have semver over individual pieces instead of the entire package. This prevents scenarios where:

Vercel now supports monorepos for improved flexibility at scale. From the same Git repository, you can set up multiple projects to be built and deployed in parallel.
Monorepos let your team use multiple programming languages and frameworks, collaborate better, and leverage micro frontend architectures.

## Monorepo

> Juggling a multimodule project over multiple repos is like trying to teach a newborn baby how to ride a bike. (From Babel)

A monorepo approach is when all officially maintained modules are in the same repo.

This is quite taboo but let's look at the pros and cons:

**Pros:**

- Single lint, build, test and release process.
- Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
- Single place to report issues.
- Easier to setup a development environment.
- Tests across modules are run together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules more easily.

**Cons:**

- Codebase looks more intimidating.
- Repo is bigger in size.
- [Can't `npm install` modules directly from GitHub](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2974) _(Solved using Yarn Workspaces)_
- ???

**This is dumb! Nobody in open source does this!** [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages), [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages), [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages), among others, do this.

### Lerna

> The tool for managing the monorepo in Babel has been extracted out as [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)

[Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) give us the ability to build libraries and apps in a single repo (a.k.a. [Monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)) without forcing us to publish to NPM until we are ready. This makes it faster to iterate locally when building components that depend on each other.

Lerna also provides high-level commands to optimize the management of multiple packages. For example, with one Lerna command, you can iterate through all the packages, running a series of operations (such as linting, testing, and building) on each package.

## Project

In this guide, we will be utilizing:

- 🐉 [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) — The Monorepo manager
- 📦 [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) — Sane multi-package management
- 🚀 [React](https://reactjs.org/) — JavaScript library for user interfaces
- 💅 [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) — CSS in JS elegance
- 🛠 [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) — Compiles next-gen JavaScript
- 📖 [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) — UI Component Environment
- 🃏 [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) — Unit/Snapshot Testing

You can either follow along or view the finished repo here.

Okay, let’s begin! First, let’s create a new project and set up Lerna.

```bash
$ mkdir monorepo
$ cd monorepo
$ npx lerna init
```

This creates a `package.json` file for your project.

```json:package.json
{
  "name": "root",
  "private": true,
  "devDependencies": {
    "lerna": "^3.22.1"
  }
}
```

You’ll notice a `lerna.json` file has also been created, as well as a `/packages` folder which will contain our libraries. Let’s now modify our `lerna.json` file to use Yarn Workspaces.
We’ll use independent versioning so we can properly enforce [semver](https://semver.org/) for each package.

```json:lerna.json
{
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
  "npmClient": "yarn",
  "useWorkspaces": true,
  "version": "independent"
}
```

We’ll also need to modify our `package.json` to define where the Yarn workspaces are located.

```json:package.json
{
  "name": "root",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "devDependencies": {
    "lerna": "^3.22.1"
  }
}
```

Now, let’s create our frontend application with create-next-app. This allows us to quickly start a new NextJS application.

```bash
npx create-next-app packages/website
```

Let’s run our NextJS application to make sure it works. Run the following from the root directory. Our app should compile and run on localhost:3000. Using --cwd tells yarn to use packages/website as it’s current working directory.
yarn --cwd packages/website dev
Open your browser to make sure it’s working. It should look like this screenshot.

### Adding another package

Now that we have created our website package, it’s time to add another. Let’s create our components package.

## Module Federation

Module Federation is a feature builtin in Webpack 5, it's a new way to share components or any javascrfipt code between any webpack application.
NextJS 10 is webpack. Micro site architecture, multiple Next.js applications all of eachs contributing to one website. Example: 1 consitent header,
Instead creating an NPM package for the Header and pushing releases and then versioning all the applications
Expose a Header from one of those applications with all it's dependencies and consume that live in any ohter application just if as it was another component.

### Conclusion

I feel that Microfrontends is a viable solution for scaling frontend within large teams (> 30 developers) working on a single codebase. Even though teams built this way are a product of the organisation’s communication structure, at this scale, it might be a necessary cost in exchange for faster deliveries. Scaling Microfrontends from 30 developers to 100 is a log operation and could incentivise large organisations to structure the teams after the business domain.

On the other side, Microfrontends would be an unnecessary complication for smaller teams where a Monolith could be improved and scaled by simply investing in better engineering standards.
