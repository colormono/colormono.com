## Usage

<Step number={1} title="Create Spotify Application" />

First, we need to create a Spotify application to give us credentials to authenticate with the API.

- Go to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in.
- Click **Create an App**.
- Fill out the name and description and click **create**.
- Click **Show Client Secret**.
- Save your Client ID and Secret. You'll need these soon.
- Click **Edit Settings**.
- Add `http://localhost:3000` as a redirect URI.

All done! You now have a properly configured Spotify application and the correct credentials to make requests.

<Step number={2} title="Authentication" />

There are a variety of ways to authenticate with the Spotify API, depending on your application. Since we only need permission granted _once_, we'll use the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow).

First, we'll have our application request authorization by logging in with whatever [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes) we need.
Here's an example of what the URL might look like.
Swap out the `client_id` and scopes for your own.

```bash
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=8e94bde7dd
b84a1f7a0e51bf3bc95be8&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http
%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&scope=user-read-currently-playing%20
user-top-read
```

After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to your `redirect_uri`.
In the URL, there's a `code` query parameter. Save this value.

```bash
http://localhost:3000/callback?code=NApCCg..BkWtQ
```

Next, we'll need to retrieve the refresh token. You'll need to generate a Base 64 encoded string containing the client ID and secret from earlier. You can use [this tool](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode it online. The format should be `client_id:client_secret`.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client_id:client_secret>"
-d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=<code> -d redirect_uri=http%3A
%2F%2Flocalhost:3000 https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
```

This will return a JSON response containing a `refresh_token`. This token is [valid indefinitely](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/374) unless you revoke access, so we'll want to save this in an environment variable.

<Step number={3} title="Add Environment Variables" />

To securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request.
We also _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.
