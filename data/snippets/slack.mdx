## Usage

<Step number={1} title="Create a Slack App" />

First, [create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1).
If you don't have an organization yet, you'll also need to [create one](https://slack.com/create).

<Step number={2} title="Add Slash Command" />

With your app created, you can define a slash command.

1. Navigate to "Slash Commands" and click "Create New Command".
2. Fill out the form using the deployed URL for your function.
3. Hit "Save".

<Step number={3} title="Add To Workspace" />

Navigate back to "Basic Information" click "Install App to Workspace".
Make note of the Verification Token. We need to add this as an environment variable.

<Step number={4} title="Add Environment Variable" />

To securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request.
We also _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.
Learn how to add [environment variables in Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables).
