## Usage

<Step number={1} title="Create Gumroad Account" />

First, [create a Gumroad account](https://gumroad.com/). Then, navigate to the [Applications tab](https://gumroad.com/settings/authorized_applications) and create a new app.

<Step number={2} title="Save Application Secret" />

Make note of your "Application Secret". Since we're communicating [server to server](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account), we only need the secret.

<Step number={3} title="Add Environment Variable" />

To securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request.
We also _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.
Learn how to add [environment variables in Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables).
