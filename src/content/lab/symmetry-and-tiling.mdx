This is a guide to creating tiling patterns using symmetry and recursion. The idea is to create a grid of squares, and then recursively subdivide each square into smaller squares. The process is repeated until the squares are too small to subdivide further. The result is a tiling pattern that is both symmetrical and self-similar.
