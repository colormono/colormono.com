From a young age, I always had a great curiosity for art and technology,
which led me to study the [Bachelor of Multimedia Arts](https://multimedia.una.edu.ar/carreras/licenciatura-en-artes-multimediales_16580)
at the National University of the Arts.

During my career, I had the opportunity to work on
[projects](/work) that combine different artistic disciplines,
such as [music](/work/music), [dance](/works/fractal), [video games](/lab/snacks),
and [visual arts](/works/hasta-las-estrellas). However, my greatest motivation
has always been generative art. This involves creating artwork using algorithms and computational systems, allowing the creation of patterns and forms that can evoke nature, the complexity of the universe, or simply random beauty. I am very
drawn to this form of art as it allows me to explore new forms of
expression and creative experimentation.

In addition to my work as a **software developer**,
I am also involved in personal projects and collaborate with other
artists. I am a
**lecturer in Introduction to Programming** in the [Bachelor of Arts and Technologies](https://artesytecnologias.unq.edu.ar/)
at the National University of Quilmes, where I feel very fortunate to be able
to share my multimedia passion.

I believe that the combination of **art and technology** is a powerful form
of expression, and I am excited to continue exploring new possibilities in this
exciting field.

Have a nice day ðŸ‘‹
