From a young age, I always had a great curiosity for art and technology,
which led me to study the [Bachelor of Multimedia Arts](https://multimedia.una.edu.ar/carreras/licenciatura-en-artes-multimediales_16580)
at the National University of the Arts.

During my career, I had the opportunity to work on
[projects](/works) that combine different artistic disciplines,
such as [music](/works/musica), [dance](/works/fractal), [video games](/lab/invisible-touch),
and [visual arts](/works/hasta-las-estrellas). However, my greatest motivation
has always been [generative art](/works/recreo). This involves creating artwork using algorithms and computational systems, allowing the creation of patterns and forms that can evoke nature, the complexity of the universe, or simply random beauty. I am very
drawn to this form of art as it allows me to explore new forms of
expression and creative experimentation.

In addition to my personal projects, I do **software engineering** at [TrueNorth](https://truenorth.co) and
I am a **teacher of Introduction to Programming** in the [Bachelor of Arts and Technologies](https://artesytecnologias.unq.edu.ar/)
at the National University of Quilmes, where I feel very fortunate to be able
to share my passion for **art and technology**.

Have a nice day ðŸ‘‹
